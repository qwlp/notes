Chapter 1: Database Systems

# Why Databases?

* Data is everywhere, we always generate data, we can't escape from it, everywhere we go we will see data.
* Data is essential for organizations to survive. (Try to operate a business without knowing who your customers are)

# Data versus Information

* Data consists of raw facts (raw means that the facts has not yet been processed to reveal their meaning)
* Information is the result of processing raw data to reveal its meaning. (It can be simple but also can be very complex)
* Information requires context. (Temperature of 105 degrees does not mean anything, is it in Celsius or is it in Fahrenheit)
* Knowledge is the body of information and facts about a specific subject.

* Data management is the discipline that focuses on the proper generation, storage, and retrieval of data.

# Introducing the Database

* A **database**  is a shared, integrated computer structure that stores a collection of the following:
  - End-user data —  raw facts of interest to the end user.
  - Metadata —  data about data (sometimes you hear a database described as a collection of self-describing data, data about data characteristics and relationship)

## Role and Advantages of the DMBS

* A database management system (DBMS) is a collection of programs that manages the database structure and controls the access to the data stored in the database.

* User -> DBMS -> Database
* The DMBS abstracts much of the database's internal complexity from the application programs and users. (The program might be written in some other language or a utility program of the DMBS.)
* Advantages of a DBMS:
  - Improved data sharing, security and integration.
  - Minimized data inconsistency (It exists when different versions of the same data appear in different places. Example: When a company's sales department has a sales representative named Bill Brown and the company's personnel department has a person's named William G. Brown, or when different branches of the companies sell a product at different prices.)
  - Improved data access through querying (a question or task asked by the end-user). A query is a question, an ad hoc query is a "spur-of-the-moment" question, the DBMS sends back a query result set
  - Better decision making
  - Increased end-user productivity.

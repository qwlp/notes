# Categories

The **five commonly used categories of SQL** are:

1. **Data Query Language (DQL)**
2. **Data Definition Language (DDL)**
3. **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**
4. **Data Control Language (DCL)**
5. **Transaction Control Language (TCL)**

Here is a detailed breakdown of each category and its commands:

### 1. Data Query Language (DQL)

DQL commands are utilized to retrieve data from a database. The primary command in this category is **`SELECT`**, which is used to query and retrieve data from one or more database tables.

### 2. Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL commands are used to define, modify, and manage the structure of database objects. Common DDL commands include:

* **`CREATE`** (used to establish tables, indexes, and other database objects).
* **`ALTER`** (used to modify existing database objects).
* **`DROP`** (used to delete database objects).

### 3. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML commands are used to manipulate the actual data stored in the database. Common DML commands include:

* **`INSERT`** (used to add new records/rows to a table).
* **`UPDATE`** (used to modify existing records).
* **`DELETE`** (used to remove records).

### 4. Data Control Language (DCL)

DCL commands are used to control access to data within the database. They deal with managing user permissions and rights:

* **`GRANT`** (used to give permissions to specific users or roles).
* **`REVOKE`** (used to revoke previously granted permissions).

### 5. Transaction Control Language (TCL)

TCL commands are used to manage transactions in the database. Transactions are defined as sequences of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single unit of work. Common TCL commands include:

* **`COMMIT`** (used to save changes made during a transaction).
* **`ROLLBACK`** (used to undo changes made during a transaction).

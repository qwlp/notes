- Data is just information, can be a list something

Since data is broad, databases are also dang broad

- Everything is ran on a database, everything that is data is stored in the backend, things like passwords, username and everything.
- Spread sheets are good, but they lack complexity
- Databases can use query to filter for information
- Databases allow different users to access different information.

- A spreadsheet kinda gives you access too everything unless you break them up which is annoying
